<h3>A Never Ending Journey in EducationðŸŒ±</h3>

<h4>Chapter 1. English Language and LiteratureðŸ’¬</h4>
<p>
  Exploring the world of English has been a passion of mine throughout my education. 
  By focusing my studies on English literature, from the beauty of classic novels to the diversity of modern media, I am continually captivated by the power of words to inspire, and educate. 
  And I found out that language itself shapes our world- to communicate, connect, and create. 
  I have also come to appreciate the value of culture as a means of understanding ourselves, our histories, and the world around us.

<h4>Chapter 2. Teaching Profession and Educationâš¡</h4>
<p>
  Connecting with students goes beyond just imparting knowledge. 
  During my time teaching at a middle school, I discovered that building meaningful relationships with my students was the key to unlocking their full potential. 
  As an empathy facilitator, I strive to create a welcoming environment where students feel heard and understood.
</p>

<h4>Chapter 3. Computer Science and EngineeringðŸ”­</h4>
<p>
  Recently I find myself increasingly fascinated by the possibilities and potential applications of technologies, as technology continues to advance at an impressive rate. 
  So I continue to pursue my education and explore my interests in these fields, and someday I want to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world around me.
