  <h3>A Never Ending Journey in Education🌱</h3>
  
  <h4>Chapter 1. English Language and Literature💬</h4>
  <p>
    Exploring the world of English has been a passion of mine throughout my education. 
    By focusing my studies on English literature, from the beauty of classic novels to the diversity of modern media, I am continually captivated by the power of words to inspire, and educate. 
    And I found out that language itself shapes our world- to communicate, connect, and create. 
    I have also come to appreciate the value of culture as a means of understanding ourselves, our histories, and the world around us.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Chapter 2. Teaching Profession and Education⚡</h4>
  <p>
    Connecting with students goes beyond just imparting knowledge. 
    During my time teaching at a middle school, I discovered that building meaningful relationships with my students was the key to unlocking their full potential. 
    As an empathy facilitator, I strive to create a welcoming environment where students feel heard and understood.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Chapter 3. Computer Science and Engineering🔭</h4>
  <p>
    Recently I find myself increasingly fascinated by the possibilities and potential applications of technologies, as technology continues to advance at an impressive rate. 
    So I continue to pursue my education and explore my interests in these fields, and someday I want to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world around me.
