<h3>A Never Ending Journey in EducationðŸŒ±</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Chapter 1. English Language and LiteratureðŸ’¬</h4>
<p>
Exploring the world of English has been a passion of mine throughout my education. By focusing my studies on English literature, from the beauty of classic novels to the diversity of modern media, I am continually captivated by the power of words to inspire, and educate. And I found out that language itself shapes our world- to communicate, connect, and create. I have also come to appreciate the value of culture as a means of understanding ourselves, our histories, and the world around us.

<h4>Chapter 2. Certification in Educationâš¡</h4>
<p>
Connecting with students goes beyond just imparting knowledge. During my time teaching at a middle school, I discovered that building meaningful relationships with my students was the key to unlocking their full potential. As an empathy facilitator, I strive to create a welcoming environment where students feel heard and understood.
</p>
<h4>Chapter 3. Computer Science and EngineeringðŸ”­</h4>
<p>
Recently I find myself increasingly fascinated by the possibilities and potential applications of technologies, as technology continues to advance at an impressive rate. So I continue to pursue my education and explore my interests in these fields, and someday I want to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world around me.
